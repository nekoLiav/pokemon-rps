# pokemon-rps

The goal of this project was to making a relatively unique, functional version of rock, paper, scissors. Over time I will perhaps try to update it or refactor it using React to making it nicer. It'll do for now, and it more than fulfills the project asks.

Don't judge my redundant, borderline unreadable spaghetti code! :)
